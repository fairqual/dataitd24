\title{Workshop Part 2 Challenge-Approach Data}
\format{
A tibble with 9 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{group}{Combined workshop groups. Character variable with
values "ac" (groups a and c combined) or "bd" (groups b and d
combined).}
\item{challenge}{Data sharing challenge identified by the group.
Character variable containing specific challenges such as
anonymization difficulties, data misuse concerns, ethics
alignment, AI implications, and politicization risks.}
\item{approach}{Proposed approach or solution to address the
identified challenge. Character variable containing strategies
like obtaining proper ethics approval, metadata documentation,
participant co-creation, and approval processes. Some entries
may be "na" where no specific approach was proposed.}

\description{
Data from the second part of the FAIRqual workshop where groups
were combined (a+c and b+d) to identify key challenges in sharing
qualitative data and propose approaches to address them. This
exercise focused on synthesizing insights from part 1 into
actionable challenges and solutions.
}
\details{
In this workshop phase, the four original groups were merged into
two larger groups to facilitate deeper discussion and synthesis.
Each combined group identified multiple challenges and attempted
to propose practical approaches for addressing them. The challenges
reflect key concerns about sharing qualitative data in
transdisciplinary research contexts.
